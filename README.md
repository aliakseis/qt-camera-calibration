*Computer Vision course - [Politecnico di Torino](http://www.polito.it) - academic year 2012-2013*

A project, made in Qt Creator, for calibrating a webcam by using OpenCV 2.4.3 and a chessboard pattern.

Before using such a project, you must open its `.pro` files and edit the path to the OpenCV library, which should be already installed on your computer.
